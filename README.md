# FACEID: learning face recognition/identification with neural network

## Structure of the code
1. [module]: key components for the learning task
2. train.py: invoke training
3. infer.py: invoke inference of trained models
4. config.py: this is where all specifiable parameters are defined
5. [script]: shell scripts that runs train.py
6. [tool]: has nothing to do with training, helps to tidy things up

## Train
After acquiring of the datasets, one could simply invoke train.py to train a model. 

Please refer to script/93-train.sh.
